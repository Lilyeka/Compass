# Compass (Example of layer hit-testing)

We have a compass with arrow and we want to know whether the user tapped on the arrow layer, and if so, we’ll rotate the arrow. 


For simplicity, we’ve given the CompassView a UITapGestureRecognizer, and this is its action method, in the CompassView itself.
